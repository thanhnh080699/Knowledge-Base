# Server Management

> Server management principles for production operations.
> **Learn to THINK, not memorize commands.**

## 1. Process Management Principles

### Tool Selection

| Scenario | Tool |
|----------|------|
| **Node.js app** | PM2 (clustering, reload) |
| **Any app** | systemd (Linux native) |
| **Containers** | Docker/Podman |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes, Docker Swarm |

### Process Management Goals

| Goal | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Restart on crash** | Auto-recovery |
| **Zero-downtime reload** | No service interruption |
| **Clustering** | Use all CPU cores |
| **Persistence** | Survive server reboot |

## 2. Monitoring Principles

### What to Monitor

| Category | Key Metrics |
|----------|-------------|
| **Availability** | Uptime, health checks |
| **Performance** | Response time, throughput |
| **Errors** | Error rate, types |
| **Resources** | CPU, memory, disk |

### Alert Severity Strategy

| Level | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate action |
| **Warning** | Investigate soon |
| **Info** | Review daily |

### Monitoring Tool Selection

| Need | Options |
|------|---------|
| Simple/Free | PM2 metrics, htop |
| Full observability | Grafana, Datadog |
| Error tracking | Sentry |
| Uptime | UptimeRobot, Pingdom |

## 3. Log Management Principles

### Log Strategy

| Log Type | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Application logs** | Debugging and audit trails |
| **Access logs** | Traffic analysis and security |
| **System logs** | OS and hardware health |
